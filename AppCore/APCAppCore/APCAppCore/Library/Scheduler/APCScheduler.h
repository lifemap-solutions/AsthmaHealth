/**
 Manages tasks and schedules.
 
 Specifically, manages the processes of downloading 
 tasks and schedules, merging them with existing ones,
 figuring out which ones are "active" or "current,"
 figuring out which to display on a given day in 
 the future or past.  Maintains a cache of the query
 results for each type of query, because each query
 is actually time-consuming:  we not only pull
 stuff from CoreData, but do a fair amount of math
 to figure out how to project schedules onto a
 human calendar.
 
 Please note.  As of this writing, this class contains
 a bunch of code that should be distributed across
 other classes.  It was easier to develop the logic
 for all those pieces if I could physically see them on
 one screen.  Having done that, we should be able to
 fairly easily redistribute the pieces to other,
 appropriate classes.  Before this, all these pieces
 had evolved in place, and it showed.
