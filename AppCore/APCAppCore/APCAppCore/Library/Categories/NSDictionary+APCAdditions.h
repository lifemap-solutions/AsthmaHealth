/**
 Loads the specified file from disk, attempts to interpret it
 as a JSON dictionary, and returns the resulting NSDictionary.
 If it encounters a problem, stops, returns nil, and optionally
 returns an error in the specified error object.
 
 @param filename The normal-looking name of a file in the
 specified bundle, like "temp.json".
 
 @param bundle The application bundle in which to search for this
 file.  Pass nil to use the "main" bundle [NSBundle mainBundle].
 
 @param errorToReturn Will contain the error results, if any, or
 will be nil if there was no error.  Pass nil if you want to
 ignore this value.  You can still check the result value for nil
 to see if there was a problem.
 
 @return an NSDictionary containing the contents of the specified
 file, or nil if there was a problem.
