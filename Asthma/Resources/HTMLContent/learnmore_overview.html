PURPOSE OF THE STUDY
<br>
<br>
People with Asthma can have very different and more or less severe symptoms day to day. This affects quality of life and makes managing treatment difficult. We would like to understand the causes of these symptom variations.
<br>
<br>
New technologies allow people to record and track their health and symptoms in real time.  This study will monitor individualâ€™s health and symptoms using questionnaires and sensors via a mobile phone application and wearable devices if available.
<br>
<br>
Your data, without your name, will be added to the data of other study participants and made available to groups of researchers for analysis and future research. You also will have a unique account that you can use to review your own data.  We anticipate enrolling 100 subjects in the study.
