<p>We will work hard to protect your privacy. A random code instead of your name or other information that could identify you will be used on all your study data. Researchers will only analyze data without information that identifies you.</p>

<p>Your study data will be coded and stored in a manner that keeps your information as safe as possible and prevents unauthorized people from getting to your data. Even with removal of your personal information and these procedures, it is sometimes possible to re-identify an individual. This risk, while very low, should still be considered before enrolling.</p>
