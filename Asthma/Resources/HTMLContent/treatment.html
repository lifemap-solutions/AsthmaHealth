    <p>Never before have we had so many good, safe, oral and inhaled drugs for the treatment of asthma as we do today. Work with your physician to determine the optimum medication regimen for achieving control over your asthma.</p>

<p>Asthma medications are usually separated into specific categories, as follows:</p>



    <p><boldie>Quick-Relief Medications</boldie><br />
    Quick-relief medications are used to treat asthma symptoms or an asthma episode. They are generally not used on a daily basis, unless your asthma is not well controlled. If this is the case, speak with your physician.</p>

    <p><boldie>Long-Term Control Medications</boldie><br />
    Long-term control medications are used daily to maintain control of asthma symptoms. These medications are in different categories and can be used alone or in combination with others. They are to be taken every day, even when you are doing well, to prevent episodes.</p>

    <p><boldie>Devices for Inhaled Medications</boldie><br />
    There are a number of devices that help deliver inhaled lung medications directly to the airways: metered-dose inhalers, dry powder inhalers, and nebulizers</p>

     <p><boldie>Alternative Therapies</boldie><br />
    Along with asthma medications, alternative therapies may assist in managing asthma on a daily basis. Discuss these with your physician.</p>
