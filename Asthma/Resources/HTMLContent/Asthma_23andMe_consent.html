<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>WHAT IS A RESEARCH STUDY?</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">A </span><span class="s1">research study is when scientists try to answer a question about something that we don’t know enough about. Participating in a research study may not help you or others.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">People volunteer to be in a research study. The decision about whether or not to take part is totally up to you. You can also agree to take part now and later change your mind. Whatever you decide is okay. It will not affect your ability to get medical care within the Mount Sinai Health System.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Someone is available to explain this research study to you. Feel free to ask any questions before you decide.  Any new information that develops during this research study that might make you change your mind about participating will be given to you promptly.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Basic information about this study will appear on the website http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov.  There are a few reasons for this:  the National Institutes of Health (NIH) encourages all researchers to post their research; some medical journals only accept articles if the research was posted on the website; and, for research studies the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) calls "applicable clinical trials” a description of this clinical trial will be available on http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov, as required by U.S. Law. This Web site will not include information that can identify you. At most, the Web site will include a summary of the results. You can search this Web site at any time</span><span class="s3">.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>PURPOSE OF THIS RESEARCH STUDY:</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The </span><span class="s1">purpose of this study is to advance our understanding of the role of genetics in asthma.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Genes are the basic “instruction book” for the cells that make up our bodies. All genes are made of DNA.  The DNA of a person is more than 99% the same as the DNA of any other person; identical twins share 100% of their DNA. By comparing your DNA and health data with that of other people we can identify patterns and relationships in genes and environment to help us better understand health and disease. Thus, the purpose of the AMHA2.0 genetics study is to learn about the connection between DNA and asthma.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">This study is designed to allow you to upload and share your genetic data from 23andMe with this research study. You may qualify to take part in this research study because you have consented and are currently participating in the Asthma Mobile Health Application 2.0 (AMHA2.0) study and you are a customer of 23andMe. You have allowed 23andMe to store your genetic data obtained from a saliva or blood sample and are now interested in giving authorization to share your 23andMe genetic data with AMHA2.0.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Participating in this sub-study is totally up to you. It does NOT affect your participation in the Asthma Mobile Health study.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>LENGTH OF TIME AND NUMBER OF PEOPLE EXPECTED TO PARTICIPATE</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Your </span><span class="s1">participation in this research study is expected to last 12 months; approximately 30 minutes for the consent process and a survey 6 months and 12 months after you enroll.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The number of people expected to take part in this research study is difficult to predict but may be hundreds to tens of thousands of people. More than 8,000 people participated in our first digital asthma study</span><span class="s3">.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>DESCRIPTION OF WHAT’S INVOLVED:</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">In the past few months, 23andMe has partnered with Apple to build an app feature that allows ResearchKit mobile apps to easily import genetic data from 23andMe. ResearchKit is an open source framework introduced by Apple that allows researchers and developers to create powerful apps for medical research.The AMHA2.0 study team has entered into a collaboration with 23andMe in order to learn more about how DNA and genes impact asthma by incorporating the 23andMe genetics app feature into the AMHA2.0 app.  Existing customers of 23andMe who agree to participate in the AMHA2.0 study have the option to share genetic data with AMHA2.0.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If you agree to participate in this research study, the following information describes what may be involved.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><p class="p17"><span class="s1">ELECTRONIC CONSENTING: This consent form will tell you about this study to help you make your choice on whether or not to participate. Please take the time to read this carefully before making your choice. If you have any questions or anything is unclear please contact the study team. If you choose to participate in this study, you will be asked a series of questions to ensure you have enough information about the AMHA2.0 genetics study to make your decision.  After submitting answers to the quiz questions you will then be asked to electronically sign this consent form on your phone. You should not give consent or start any part of the study until your questions are answered and you are ready and able to begin.</span></p></li>
<li><p class="p17"><span class="s1">SHARING GENETIC DATA WITH AMHA 2.0: The AMHA2.0 app will enable you to tap into and share your 23andMe genetic data with the AMHA 2.0 study investigators following the signing of this consent. If you agree to share your 23andMe genetic data with the Asthma Health app your data will be sent from 23andMe computers to your phone and then AMHA2.0 computers using the same security methods banks and hospitals trust to transfer their data.  Your 23andMe genetic data will be securely stored and connected to your AMHA2.0 data using a randomly generated code. You will not receive any feedback about your personal genetic information, nor will it or can it replace medical care for your asthma.</span></p></li>
<li><p class="p17"><span class="s1">AMHA2.0 PARTICIPATION: If you are reading this consent form you have already joined the main AMHA2.0 study, thank you! By completing the surveys about your asthma and health you will help create a rich dataset that scientists can use to identify behaviors that help control or worsen asthma.</span></p></li>
<li><p class="p17"><span class="s1">6 MONTH SURVEY: In order to learn more about your views on sharing your genetics data we will ask you to complete a survey 6 months after enrollment in this study.</span></p></li>
</ol>
<p class="p18"><span class="s1"><b></b></span><br></p>
<p class="p16"><span class="s1"><b>What we will and will not do with your data</b></span></p>
<ul>
<li><p class="p19"><span class="s1"><b>De-identification:</b> In order to protect your privacy, we will use a random code instead of your name to identify your AMHA2.0 and 23andMe genetic data. We are required to store your electronically signed consent form with your randomly assigned code, which can link your name to your data. In order to protect your privacy only a very small number of study investigators will have access to your signed consent form and your random code. Furthermore, all of the survey and device information that identifies you will be removed from study data before it is shared with any research team for analysis and will be stored separately from your genetic data and linked through study number.</span></p></li>
<li><p class="p19"><span class="s1"><b>Use in research:</b> Your genetic study data will be transferred to a computer where your genetic and health data can be used by researchers who have obtained permission to use the AMHA Study data. Your study data may be shared with other researchers outside of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and the Mount Sinai Hospital ("Mount Sinai"), but we will not share your information with any advertisers or other commercial third parties. We will NOT access your personal contacts, other applications, phone use habits, text message content, personal photos, or websites visited. Data will be stored in a manner that maintains strict information technology procedures to safeguard participant information and to prevent improper access.</span></p><p class="p17"><span class="s1">While we will not provide any information regarding your personal genetic data, you can check the project’s web site at asthmamobilehealth@mssm.edu to read about the project’s progress and to see if there are any general results.</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES IF YOU TAKE PART IN THIS RESEARCH:</b></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If you decide to take part in this research study you will be responsible for the following things:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li20"><p><span class="s1"><em>Consenting and uploading your 23andMe genetic data through this module.</em></span></p></li>
  <li class="li20"><p><span class="s1"><em>Completing the 6 and 12-month surveys about sharing genetic data.</em></span></p></li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>COSTS OR PAYMENTS THAT MAY RESULT FROM PARTICIPATION:</b></span></p>
<p class="p22"><span class="s1">You will not be paid for participating in this research study. Being in this research study will not lead to extra costs to you other than usage of your mobile data plan if applicable. Data collected in this study will count against your existing mobile data plan but you can set up the "asthma app" to only use Wi-Fi connections to limit impact on your data plan.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>POSSIBLE BENEFITS:</b></span></p>
<p class="p23"><span class="s1">It is important for you to know that you may not get any benefit from taking part in this research. Others may not benefit either. However, possible benefits may be that what we learn from the study may help doctors better understand asthma and design better mobile applications. It is important to realize that knowledge gained from research studies offers the most benefit to people who are similar to the study participants. Therefore, we expect your participation to provide information that is most relevant to your current and future relatives</span><span class="s3">.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>REASONABLY FORESEEABLE RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS:</b></span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="s1">Much like fingerprints, it is possible to identify someone if certain data are put together. While we use very strict data security measures to protect your privacy, there is always a small risk that your data may lead to you being re-identified. As technology advances, there may be new ways of linking data back to you that we cannot foresee today.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="s1">There is a possibility that the genetic data, even when presented without other identifying factors, could allow you to be re-identified, and therefore this research study cannot promise anonymity.</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="s1">There is a small risk that you may face discrimination on the basis of genetic predispositions that are identified through this project.  Sometimes patients have been required to furnish information from genetic testing for health insurance, life insurance, and/or a job. A federal law, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 (GINA), generally makes it illegal for health insurance companies, group health plans, and employers with 15 or more employees to discriminate against you based on your genetic information.  It is important to note that GINA does not provide protections against discrimination when applying for longer term care insurance, disability insurance, or life insurance.</span></p>
<p class="p24"><span class="s1">Since the database contains genetic information, a break in security may also pose a potential risk to blood relatives as well as yourself.  For example, it could be used to make it harder for you (or a relative) to get or keep a job or insurance.  If your private information was misused it is possible you would also experience other harms, such as stress, anxiety, stigmatization, or embarrassment from revealing information about your family, relationships, ethnic heritage, or health conditions.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>OTHER POSSIBLE OPTIONS TO CONSIDER:</b></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">You may decide not to take part in this research study without any penalty.  The choice is totally up to you</span><span class="s3">.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>IN CASE OF INJURY DURING THIS RESEARCH STUDY:</b></span></p>
<p class="p25"><span class="s1">This study does not provide any compensation, health, or medical care to participants. If you are injured as a direct result of your participation in this study, the Principal Investigator and the research study staff will assist you in obtaining appropriate medical treatment. Your medical insurance, managed care plan, or other benefits program will be billed for this treatment. You will be responsible for any associated co-payment or deductibles as required by your insurance. If costs of care related to such an injury are not covered by your medical insurance, managed care plan, or other benefits program, you may be responsible for these costs. The sponsor will not pay charges that your insurance does not cover. No payment is available from the study sponsor</span><span class="s3">.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>ENDING PARTICIPATION IN THE RESEARCH STUDY:</b></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">You may stop taking part in this research study at any time without any penalty. This will not affect your ability to receive medical care at any of the Mount Sinai Health System hospitals or to receive any benefits to which you are otherwise entitled.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">If you decide to stop being in the research study, please contact the Principal Investigator or the research staff.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">Regardless of your decision to upload your genetic data, you may still participate in the AMHA2.0 study.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">You may also withdraw your permission for the use and disclosure of any of your protected information for research, but <u>you must do so in writing</u> to the Principal Investigator at the address on the first page. Even if you withdraw your permission, the Principal Investigator for the research study may still use the information that was already collected if that information is necessary to complete the research study. Your health information may still be used or shared after you withdraw your authorization if you have an adverse event (a bad effect) from participating in the research study.</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1"><u>Withdrawal without your consent:</u> The study doctor, the sponsor or the institution may stop your involvement in this research study at any time without your consent. This may be because the research study is being stopped, the instructions of the study team have not been followed, the investigator believes it is in your best interest, or for any other reason. If data have been stored as part of the research study, they too can be destroyed without your consent.  Any data already used, however, will be used in ongoing analyses.</span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>DISCLOSURE OF FINANCIAL INTERESTS:</b></span></p>
<p class="p29"><span class="s1">Sometimes, physicians/researchers receive payments for consulting or similar work performed for industry. Effective September 2014 Mount Sinai reviews only payments to an individual totaling more than $5,000 a year per entity when determining potential conflicts of interest. If you have questions regarding industry relationships, we encourage you to talk your physician/researcher or visit our website at <a href="http://icahn.mssm.edu/">http://icahn.mssm.edu/</a> where Mount Sinai publicly discloses the industry relationships of our faculty.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Dr. Eric Schadt (a Co-Investigator in this study and Chair of the Department of Genetics and Genomics Sciences, and Director of the Icahn Institute for Genomics and Multiscale Biology) and Dr. Joel Dudley (a Co-Investigator in this study and the Director of Biomedical Informatics at Mount Sinai School of Medicine) hold equity in the form of stock options in LifeMap, a privately held company. In addition Dr. Schadt serves as an uncompensated advisory board member for LifeMap.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Mount Sinai has entered into an agreement with LifeMap to develop consumer-friendly mobile apps. This project is being developed as part of this agreement.  Dr. Eric Schadt (as Chair of the Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences) is administratively responsible for Mount Sinai’s collaboration with LifeMap</span><span class="s3">.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>MAINTAINING CONFIDENTIALITY – HIPAA AUTHORIZATION:</b></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">As you take part in this research project it will be necessary for the research team and others to use and share some of your private protected health information. Consistent with the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), we are asking your permission to receive, use and share that information.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">What protected health information is collected and used in this study?</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">As part of this research project, the researchers may collect your name, location, telephone numbers, birth date, or e-mail/internet protocol (IP) addresses, genetic data, finger print, device ID. This will be stored separately from the other data you provide using the app.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">During the study the researchers will gather information by: taking a medical history (includes current and past medications or therapies, illnesses, conditions or symptoms, allergies, etc.) and reviewing the questionnaires explained in the description section of this consent, and reviewing genetic tests.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">What protected health information might be disclosed (shared) with others?</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Your personal contact information will only be accessed by the study team if necessary and will not be shared outside the study team. Your de-identified study data, such as survey results, which does not include any identifying personal information, may be shared with other researchers who Mount Sinai has approved to receive the study data.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Why is your protected health information being used?</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Your health information will be used for the purpose of this study as explained earlier in this consent form. The results of this study could be published or presented at scientific meetings, lectures, or other events, but would not include any information that would let others know who you are, unless you give separate permission to do so.</span></p>
<p class="p29"><span class="s1">The research team and other authorized members of the Mount Sinai workforce may use and share your information to ensure that the research meets legal, institutional or accreditation requirements. For example, the School’s Program for the Protection of Human Subjects is responsible for overseeing research on human subjects, and may need to see your information. I<b><i>f the research team uncovers abuse, neglect, or reportable diseases, this information may be disclosed to appropriate authorities.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></b></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Who, outside Mount Sinai, might receive your protected health information?</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">As part of the study, the Principal Investigator, study team and others in the Mount Sinai workforce may disclose your protected health information, including the results of the research study tests and procedures, to the following people or organizations: (It is possible that there may be changes to the list during this research study; you may request an up-to-date list at any time by contacting the Principal Investigator.)</span></p>
<p class="p30"><span class="s1">-          The United States Food and Drug Administration</span></p>
<p class="p30"><span class="s1">-          The United States Department of Health and Human Services and the Office of Human         Research Protection</span></p>
<p class="p29"><span class="s1">In all disclosures outside of Mount Sinai, you will not be identified by any direct personal identifier.unless disclosure of the direct identifier is required by law. Some records and information disclosed may be identified with a unique code number. The Principal Investigator will ensure that the key to the code will be kept in a locked file, or will be securely stored electronically. The code will not be used to link the information back to you without your permission, unless the law requires it, or rarely if the Institutional Review Board allows it after determining that there would be minimal risk to your privacy. It is possible that a sponsor or their representatives, a data coordinating office, or a contract research organization will come to inspect your records to review our compliance with the study terms. Even if those records are identifiable when inspected, theall information leaving the institutionMount Sinai will be stripped of direct identifiers. Additionally, <b><i>the monitors, auditors, the IRB, the Food and Drug Administration will be granted direct access to your medical records for verification of the research procedures and data. By signing this document you are authorizing this access.</i></b> We may publish the results of this research. However, we will keep your name and other identifying information confidential.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">For how long will Mount Sinai be able to use or disclose your protected health information? Your authorization for use of your protected health information for this specific study does not expire.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Will you be able to access your records?</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">While you are participating in the study, you will be able to view the answers you have given through the “asthma app.” Once you have finished participating in the study, you will no longer be able to view your study data because it will become disassociated with you and therefore cannot be traced back to you.</span></p>
<p class="p29"><span class="s1">This will be done to prevent the knowledge of study results from affecting the reliability of the study. Your information will be available should an emergency arise that would require your treating physician to know this information to best treat you. You will have access to your own medical record and any study information that is part of that record when the study is over or earlier, if possible. The investigator/researcher is not required to release to you research information that is not part of your medical record and no information regarding other participants will be released to you.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Do you need to give us permission to obtain, use or share your health information?</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">NO! If you decide not to let us obtain, use or share your health information you should not sign this form, and you will not be allowed to volunteer in the research study. If you do not sign, it will not affect your treatment, payment or enrollment in any health plans or affect your eligibility for benefits.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Can you change your mind?</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">You may withdraw your permission for the use and disclosure of any of your protected information for research, but you must do so in writing to the Principal Investigator at the address on the first page. Even if you withdraw your permission, the Principal Investigator for the research study may still use your protected information that was already collected if that information is necessary to complete the study. Your health information may still be used or shared after you withdraw your authorization if you should have an adverse event (a bad effect) from being in the study. If you withdraw your permission to use your protected health information for research that means you will also be withdrawn from the research study, but standard medical care and any other benefits to which you are entitled will not be affected. You can also tell us you want to withdraw from the research study at any time without canceling the Authorization to use your data.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">It is important for you to understand that once information is disclosed to others outside Mount Sinai, the information may be re-disclosed and will no longer be covered by the federal privacy protection regulations. However, even if your information will no longer be protected by federal regulations, where possible, Mount Sinai has entered into agreements with those who will receive your information to continue to protect your confidentiality.  In the case of this study, details linking the information you provide to you personally are separated within Mount Sinai, and your confidentiality is further protected in this way.</span></p>
